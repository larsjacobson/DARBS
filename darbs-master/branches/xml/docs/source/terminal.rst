DARBS Terminal
==============

The DARBS terminal is a simple application for communicating directly with the :doc:`blackboard`.  It is useful both for learning how the different blackboard request work, and for inspecting and debugging systems.

Actually using the terminal is very simple.  Start up a blackboard, and subsequently run the terminal.  You will be presented with a prompt, at which you can type in requests as described in the :doc:`blackboard` help file.  The response from the blackboard will then be printed under the request.
