# Branch Strategy

The Git feature branch strategy using main and develop branches is a popular workflow in software development, particularly suited for managing larger projects. This strategy helps maintain a stable codebase while allowing developers to work on new features, bug fixes, and other changes in a controlled manner. Here's a basic outline of how it works:

Key Branches
Main (Master) Branch:
The main branch (previously often called master) holds the official release history.
It's the source of truth for the production environment, meaning the code in main is always deployable.
Direct commits to this branch are typically restricted.

Develop Branch:
This branch serves as an integration branch for features.
It contains the complete history of the project, but unlike main, it also includes the latest delivered development changes.
This branch is a stepping stone to main, ensuring that main only receives stable, tested code.
Feature Branches

Creation:
For every new feature, bug fix, or enhancement, a new branch is created from develop.
These are often called "feature branches" or "topic branches."
Naming convention typically reflects the purpose (e.g., feature/add-login, bugfix/resolve-login-issue).

Development:
Development work is done on these branches and not directly on develop.
This isolation makes it easier to manage multiple features being developed in parallel.
Code Reviews and Testing:
Once a feature is complete, a pull request (PR) is opened to merge the feature branch into develop.
This triggers code reviews and automated tests to ensure code quality and functionality.

Merging to Develop:
After successful reviews and passing tests, the feature branch is merged into develop.
This keeps develop updated with the latest completed features.
Release Process

Preparation:
When it's time for a release, a release branch is created from develop.
This branch might go through a cycle of testing, bug fixes, and final adjustments.
Merging to Main and Develop:
Once the release branch is stable and ready, it's merged into main and tagged with a version number.
Also, changes made in the release branch are merged back into develop to keep it up-to-date.

Hotfixes
Direct Branch from Main:
Urgent fixes (hotfixes) are managed by creating branches directly from main.
After fixing, these are merged back into both main and develop.

Advantages
Stable Codebase: main remains stable at all times.
Parallel Development: Multiple features can be developed, tested, and merged in parallel without disrupting the main codebase.
Quality Control: Through PRs and automated tests, code quality is maintained.
Flexibility: Hotfixes can be managed without disrupting ongoing work.

1. Initialize Your Local Repository
If you haven't already, initialize your local repository:

bash
Copy code
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

2. Check for Large Files
Before pushing to GitHub, identify if there are any large files. GitHub has a limit of 100 MB per file and recommends keeping the repository size under 1 GB. To find files over a certain size (e.g., 10MB) in your repository, you can use:

bash
Copy code
git ls-files | xargs du -h | grep '^[0-9]*M'

3. Use Git Large File Storage (LFS)
For large files (especially binaries), use Git Large File Storage (LFS). This Git extension handles large files more efficiently.

Install Git LFS (if you haven't already):
bash
Copy code
git lfs install
Track large files with Git LFS:
bash
Copy code
git lfs track "*.extension"  # Replace "*.extension" with your file type
git add .gitattributes
Add the large files to Git LFS:
bash
Copy code
git add file_name.extension  # Replace with your file name
git commit -m "Add large file"

4. Optimize Repository
Remove unnecessary files and optimize your repository. You can use .gitignore to exclude files or directories:

bash
Copy code
echo "node_modules/" >> .gitignore  # Example for node_modules
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Update .gitignore"

5. Push to GitHub
Create a new repository on GitHub. Then, push your local repository to GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git remote add origin [GitHub repository URL]
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
